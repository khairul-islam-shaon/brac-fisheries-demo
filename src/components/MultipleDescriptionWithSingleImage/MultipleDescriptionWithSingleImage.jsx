                    <h3>Supplementary feeding and fertilisation in poly culture (1989-92)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In pond culture operations, inputs like supplemental feeding and fertilisation are the principal
                        determinants of production.
                        In 1989-92, BRAC carried out experiments in feeding and fertilisation in pond aquaculture with
                        feeding and feeding plus fertilisation treatments.
                        As expected, the feeding and fertilisation treatment yielded the best result in terms of
                        production and profitability.
                        This was the first-ever pond aquaculture trial with different options for the use of feed and
                        fertiliser. Based on this research,
                        the technology was disseminated widely throughout the country.

                    <h3>Koi, Shing and Magur culture (1991-92)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The indigenous stinging catfish (Heteropnuestes fossilis), commonly known as shing, is much in
                        demand,
                        both for its nutritious value and as a delicacy. Development of a culture package seed
                        production,
                        feeding, and fertilisation was deemed necessary. In 1991, artificial breeding of shing was tried
                        with hormone injection.
                        In the trial, fertilisation of eggs was possible through stripping of females and by mixing the
                        eggs
                        with milt from cut and macerated male gonads obtained by sacrificing males. However, the
                        survival rate of
                        the larvae was not satisfactory at that time. The technology of koi (Anabas testudineous) and
                        magur breeding
                        and seed production was not found to be successful for transfer to farmers. However, BRAC
                        recently started Pabda
                        and Gulsha production in its hatcheries in Pabna and Bogra.

                    <h3>Pearl culture in ponds (1990-94)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Pearl culture in rural ponds through implantation of foreign particles inside the
                        local bivalve was thought to be a potential source of income for poor people. In Kolaroa,
                        Satkhira,
                        an experiment was carried out during 1990-94 in a few freshwater ponds where implantations were
                        done,
                        but the venture was ultimately not pursued because it was not profitable.

                    <h3>Sharpunti culture (1993-95)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The cost of aquaculture is mainly due to the cost incurred on feed, even in the culture of small
                        fish species like sharpunti.
                        The integration of duckweed feeding was experimented with in many small homestead ponds in
                        Trishal, Mymensingh, and Tangail during 1993-95.
                        The venture proved highly effective in generating income for the rural poor. A similar
                        experiment was also done with
                        rice-cum-fish culture in collaboration with BARI, BRRI, DoF, and SRTI in different parts of the
                        country. Small fish
                        culture in homestead ponds and feeding with rice bran was found especially suitable for the
                        female members of households

                    <h3>Carp seed production (1998-2000)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The technology for artificial spawning of the Indian major carps was widely disseminated to
                        hatchery operators,
                        but optimisation of the hard work and pain over time, but the selection of breeding optima for
                        catla was difficult,
                        and there were repeated failures. There was a similar experience with the grass carps and common
                        carps at the initial
                        stages. BRAC embarked on research to determine the breeding optima for the carp species in its
                        Rajendrapur hatchery
                        during 1998-2000. To improve the breeding performance of the species, a number of experiments
                        were made with the hormone dose,
                        the time of injection, the ratio of males and females in breeding, and water quality
                        parameters.The protocols were eventually optimised,
                        and the technologies are now being successfully practiced in all BRAC hatcheries.

                    <h3>Quality seed production (2003-05) (2008-2012)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Under a memorandum of understanding, BRAC entered into a collaboration with the Worldfish Centre
                        to work on the
                        development of a logical breeding structure of cultured species. The aim was to produce
                        genetically fast-growing
                        strains of carp and tilapia and to disseminate the improved breeds to farmers and producers
                        throughout the country
                        so that local-level personnel could attain skills in selective breeding and genetic improvement.
                        <br/>
                        As a bid to control the inherent problem of loss of genetic variability,
                        the concepts of pyramid and cohort breeding were incorporated. In 2003, the genetic improvement
                        programme of rohu and catla was undertaken in the Sreemangal hatchery. Three wild stocks of the
                        species
                        were collected from the Halda, Padma and Jamuna rivers, and they were crossbred to produce a
                        synthetic
                        base population of six families with higher genetic variation, which was incorporated in the
                        breeding process.
                        The resultant six families were pooled to form a communal stock.
                        <br/>
                        The same trial was repeated and progenies were maintained separately. In the second generation,
                        broods were mass-selected for 20-25 percent fish from the stocks, with breeding between males
                        and females
                        from the alternate stocks. Besides this brood improvement programme, BRAC obtained improved
                        strains of Chinese
                        carp (Siver carp, Bighead, and Grass carp) from the Parbatipur facility of DoF and Indian major
                        carps, rohu, catla,
                        and sharpunti from BFRI. Later, wild stocks of rohu and catla were also obtained from Worldfish.
                        <br/>
                        In order to maintain the genetic standard of the breeding populations of BRAC hatcheries,
                        there is regular introduction of improved and unrelated germplasm in the hatcheries through
                        the exchange of broods within the BRAC hatcheries and between other sources of broods in the
                        <br/>
                        The pyramid breeding has not been applied in the breeding system of any species by any
                        organisation
                        in the country. However, cohort breeding is applied in monosex male tilapia fry production in
                        Magura hatchery.
                        The work was planned in two phases during 2008-2012 and 2013-2018. The first phase was completed
                        on the stock enhancement
                        of carp, GIFT tilapia, and prawn with fresh genetic material imported from other countries.

                    <h3>Prawn hatchery and post-larvae (PL) production (2005-08)</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        The R&D initiatives in prawn hatchery technology improvement by BRAC are highly significant.
                        BRAC gradually improved their processes by trial and error studies on hygienic conditions and biosafety protocol,
                        improvement in larval feed, and control of different physical and chemical hatchery parameters.
                        <br/>
                        The strictest adherence to the guidelines and improved monitoring procedures ultimately led to the
                        achievement of the maximum survival of the PL with an average of 60 PL/litre. BRAC was the pioneer of
                        prawn hatchery technology dissemination in the country.
